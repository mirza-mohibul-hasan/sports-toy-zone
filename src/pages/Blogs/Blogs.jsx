                <h1 className="text-xl font-semibold">Question: What is an access token and refresh token? How do they work and where should we store them on the client-side?</h1>
                <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-blue-600">Answer:</h2>
                <p className="text-base">An access token is a short-lived credential that allows a client application to access protected resources on behalf of a user. A refresh token is a long-lived credential that can be used to obtain new access tokens without requiring the user to re-authenticate.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Access tokens are typically stored in the browser local storage or session storage. Refresh tokens are typically stored in the browser localStorage or a secure key-value store.
                </p>
                <p>Access tokens and refresh tokens should be stored securely to prevent unauthorized access to protected resources.</p>

                <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-blue-600">Answer:</h2>
                <p className="text-base">SQL databases are relational databases that store data in tables. Tables are made up of rows and columns, and each row represents a single record. SQL databases are very efficient at storing and retrieving data, and they are widely used for a variety of applications.</p>
                <p>NoSQL databases are non-relational databases that store data in a variety of formats. NoSQL databases are often used for applications that require high scalability or flexibility.</p>
                <p>The best database for a particular application will depend on the specific requirements of that application.</p>

                <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-blue-600">Answer:</h2>
                <p className="text-base">Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for building web applications. It is easy to learn and use, and it is highly scalable. Express is a popular choice for building web applications of all sizes, from simple websites to complex enterprise applications.</p>
                <p>Nest is a progressive Node.js framework that combines the best of OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) and MVC (Model-View-Controller) to build scalable and maintainable web applications. Nest is built on top of Express, and it provides a number of features that make it easier to build complex applications, such as dependency injection, routing, and authentication. Nest is a popular choice for building web applications that require a high degree of scalability and maintainability.</p>

                <h1 className="text-xl font-semibold">Question: What is MongoDB aggregate and how does it work?
                </h1>
                <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-blue-600">Answer:</h2>
                <p className="text-base">Sure. MongoDB aggregate is a feature that allows you to perform complex operations on data in a MongoDB collection. It works by using a pipeline of stages, each of which performs a specific operation on the data. The stages in a pipeline are executed in sequence, and the output of each stage is passed to the next stage.</p>
                <p>Some of the most common aggregate operations are:</p>
                <p className="flex items-center"><FaArrowRight className="text-blue-500" /> <>$match: This stage filters the data in the collection based on a condition.</></p>
                <p className="flex items-center"><FaArrowRight className="text-blue-500" /> <>$group: This stage groups the data in the collection by a value and calculates a value for each group.</></p>
                <p className="flex items-center"><FaArrowRight className="text-blue-500" /> <>$project: This stage projects the data in the collection to a new format.</></p>
                <p className="flex items-center"><FaArrowRight className="text-blue-500" /> <>$sort: This stage sorts the data in the collection.</></p>
                <p className="flex items-center"><FaArrowRight className="text-blue-500" /> <>$limit: This stage limits the number of documents returned by the pipeline.</></p>
